- 👋 Hi, I’m @malevictoby
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, cyber security, discord bots, 3d printing (and in your mom).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ethical hacking, how to code discord bots.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I understand and can do, which is basically just 3d printing and Linux stuff.
